# Python_Instacart
Python code used for project in CareerFoundry to analyze data for Instacart.

## Objective 
For this project, we acted as an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The task was to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.

## Tools Used 
- Utilize various Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Import data into Jupyter notebook
- Change data types and create new dataframes 
- Perform data consistency checks such as fixing mis-type variables, finding and dealing with missing values, and finding and removing duplicate values
- Merge dataframes and export new dataframes as pickle files
- Create new columns using conditional logic in the form of if-statements, user-defined functions, the loc() function, and for-loops
- Create flags for certain pieces of data and place them in a new column
- Calculate descriptive statistics using the groupby() function
- Create histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots for different variables and relationships between variables
